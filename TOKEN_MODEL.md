# Profitia Token and Governance Model

## Token Overview

The Profitia token is freely tradable. It does not represent equity, revenue share, yield, or dividends. The token is used for access, governance, risk participation, and protocol alignment.

Explicit exclusions:

- No profit sharing
- No buyback promises
- No reflexive price support

## Reputation Layer (Soulbound)

Reputation units are non-transferable and earned through verified performance and behavior. They gate:

- Capital limits
- Market access
- Trader privileges

There is no purchase shortcut.

## Staking and Risk Pools

Token holders may stake into insurance and risk pools to backstop rare systemic events. Staking grants governance weight and access privileges. There is no APY marketing and no yield guarantee.

## Treasury Interaction

Protocol surplus funds resilience, audits, and infrastructure. It may support protocol-owned liquidity. Treasury flows are bounded and cannot be redirected to profit distribution.

## Governance Model

Governance is bounded and uses token-based voting with reputation-weighted modifiers. Excluded actions:

- Dividends
- Treasury extraction
- Trader payout manipulation

Governance scope:

- Risk parameter updates
- Market inclusion rules
- Oracle standards
- Treasury allocation ranges
